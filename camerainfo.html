                <h3>What is a camera?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Imagine a tiny magic box that can steal moments right out of real life and keep<br>
                        them forever, that’s basically what a camera means to me.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Technically, it’s a device that captures light through a lens and turns what you<br>
                        see into a photo or video. But the cool part? It’s like a time machine for emotions.<br>
                        One click can save a laugh, a sunset, or even your dog’s derpy face mid-zoomies. Lol
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Cameras aren’t just gadgets, they’re tools for telling stories without words.<br>
                        And hey, even your phone has one! So we can all be photographers now. :)
                    </p>

                <h3>How does the camera work?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In a film camera, light passes through the lens and hits the photosensitive film inside the camera.<br>
                        The film is coated with light-sensitive chemicals that react to the incoming light, capturing an image<br>
                        as a latent (invisible) image. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Process:<br>
                        - Exposure: When you take a picture, light hits the film, causing a chemical reaction that records the image.<br>
                        - Developing: The film is submerged in a series of chemical baths to make the image visible.<br>
                        - Fixing: A fixer chemical stabilizes the image, preventing further exposure to light.<br>
                        - Printing: If the film is negative (common in traditional film photography), it is used<br>
                        to create a positive print on light-sensitive paper.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        In digital camera, it works similarly to a film camera but replaces film with an image sensor (either CMOS or CCD)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Light enters the lens— the lens focuses light onto the image sensor.<br>
                        Image sensor captures the light—- the sensor, made up of millions of<br>
                        tiny photosites (pixels), converts light into an electrical signal.<br>
                        Image processing—- the camera's image processor (such as Canon’s DIGIC or Sony’s BIONZ)<br>
                        processes the raw sensor data, adjusting brightness, contrast, and colour.<br>
                        Image Storage— the processed image is saved as a JPED, RAW, or other format on a memory card/SD card.<br>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Real-Time Display— unlike film cameras, digital cameras allow you to view the image immediately on the<br>
                        LCD screen or electronic viewfinder.

                <h3>When was the first camera ever made?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Joseph Nicephore’s heliograph was the first successful attempt at capturing an image using a camera obscura<br>
                        and a light-sensitive material, though the process required extremely long exposure times. His most famous<br>
                        surviving image, View from the Window at Le Gras (1826 or 1827), is the earliest known permanent photograph. 
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Louis Daguerre built upon Niepce’s work and, in 1839, introduced the daguerreotype process. It significantly<br>
                        reduced exposure times and produced sharper, more detailed images on silver-plated copper sheets.<br>
                        The daguerreotype became the first widely adopted photographic technique, marking the true beginning of modern photography.

                <h3>Why do people not want to be photographed?</h3>
                    <p>
                        I made a survey through Google Forms for my schoolmates' voices. Based on 125 students that answered the survey are:<br>
                        36.8% of people liked being photographed because most of them are interested in photography and have confidence in<br>
                        themselves. Meanwhile, 40% of people don't like being photographed because they are self-conscious, uncomfortable,<br>
                        shy, and sometimes they just prefer being the one getting behind the camera rather than the art themselves. Lastly,<br>
                        22.4% of people don't mind getting pictures taken because they are more likely to just want to go with the flow and<br>
                        sometimes it depends on the situations or people who will take their photos.

                <h3>What is photography about and what special about it?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Photography is a powerful form of communication that transcends cultural and linguistic barriers, acting as a universal language.<br>
                        In today’s digital era, social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat have amplified its influence, enabling people to share<br>
                        experiences and emotions instantly. Photography not only captures moments but also fosters connections, promotes empathy, and highlights<br>
                        social issues, such as environmental protection. As the world becomes increasingly globalized, photography remains a crucial tool for<br>
                        storytelling, reflecting societal trends, and evolving with time.

                <h3>Why should people learn about photography?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Learning photography skills is valuable because it enhances both personal and professional opportunities. In marketing and advertising,<br>
                        high-quality images are essential for attracting customers, building brand identity, and communicating messages effectively.<br>
                        Understanding photography allows individuals and businesses to create visually appealing content, which is crucial in today’s<br>
                        digital and competitive world.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Beyond marketing, photography is a powerful form of creative self-expression. Just as renowned photographers like Erick Chmil<br>
                        use images to tell compelling stories, anyone can use photography to capture meaningful moments, share unique perspectives,<br>
                        and develop their artistic vision. Whether for professional growth, personal storytelling, or simply documenting everyday life,<br>
                        learning the basics of photography empowers people to communicate visually in a more impactful way.

                <h3>How photography helps people in their daily life?</h3>
                    <p>
                        Photography plays an important role in people’s daily lives by allowing them to shape and express their identities,<br>
                        document meaningful moments, and connect with others. Self-portraits, or selfies, have become a major part of online culture,<br>
                        helping individuals present themselves in ways that reflect their personalities and aspirations. Beyond self-expression,<br>
                        photography also enables people to challenge stereotypes and celebrate diversity. By capturing and sharing images that<br>
                        represent different perspectives, individuals can contribute to social awareness and advocate for equality.<br>
                        Moreover, photography influences how we see ourselves and others, shaping perceptions and emotions both consciously<br> 
                        and unconsciously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        On a personal level, photography helps people preserve memories, tell stories, and reflect on their experiences.<br>
                        Whether through professional photography or casual snapshots, images serve as a powerful tool for communication,<br>
                        self-discovery, and personal growth. In a rapidly changing world, photography remains an essential medium for<br>
                        defining identity and fostering connections in everyday life.

                        Photography offers numerous benefits—especially for children; fostering creativity, observation skills,<br>
                        self-expression, and confidence. It teaches patience, discipline, and storytelling while enhancing<br> 
                        technical proficiency and appreciation for the arts. Photography also encourages a connection to nature,<br>
                        creates lasting memories, promotes social interaction, and can even lead to future career opportunities.
