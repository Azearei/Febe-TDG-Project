            <h3>What is a camera?</h3>
                <p>
                    Imagine a tiny magic box that can steal moments right out of real life and keep<br>
                    them forever, that’s basically what a camera means to me.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Technically, it’s a device that captures light through a lens and turns what you<br>
                    see into a photo or video. But the cool part? It’s like a time machine for emotions.<br>
                    One click can save a laugh, a sunset, or even your dog’s derpy face mid-zoomies. Lol
                </p>

                <p>
                    Cameras aren’t just gadgets, they’re tools for telling stories without words.<br>
                    And hey, even your phone has one! So we can all be photographers now. :)

            <h3>How does the camera work? </h3>
                <p>
                    In a film camera, light passes through the lens and hits the photosensitive film inside the camera.<br>
                    The film is coated with light-sensitive chemicals that react to the incoming light, capturing an image<br>
                    as a latent (invisible) image. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Process:<br>
                    - Exposure: When you take a picture, light hits the film, causing a chemical reaction that records the image.<br>
                    - Developing: The film is submerged in a series of chemical baths to make the image visible.<br>
                    - Fixing: A fixer chemical stabilizes the image, preventing further exposure to light.<br>
                    - Printing: If the film is negative (common in traditional film photography), it is used<br>
                    to create a positive print on light-sensitive paper.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    In digital camera, it works similarly to a film camera but replaces film with an image sensor (either CMOS or CCD)
                </p>
                <p>
                    Light enters the lens— the lens focuses light onto the image sensor.<br>
                    Image sensor captures the light—- the sensor, made up of millions of<br>
                    tiny photosites (pixels), converts light into an electrical signal.<br>
                    Image processing—- the camera's image processor (such as Canon’s DIGIC or Sony’s BIONZ)<br>
                    processes the raw sensor data, adjusting brightness, contrast, and colour.<br>
                    Image Storage— the processed image is saved as a JPED, RAW, or other format on a memory card/SD card.<br>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Real-Time Display— unlike film cameras, digital cameras allow you to view the image immediately on the<br>
                    LCD screen or electronic viewfinder.

            <h3>When was the first camera ever made?</h3>
                <p>
                    Joseph Nicephore’s heliograph was the first successful attempt at capturing an image using a camera obscura<br>
                    and a light-sensitive material, though the process required extremely long exposure times. His most famous<br>
                    surviving image, View from the Window at Le Gras (1826 or 1827), is the earliest known permanent photograph. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Louis Daguerre built upon Niepce’s work and, in 1839, introduced the daguerreotype process. It significantly<br>
                    reduced exposure times and produced sharper, more detailed images on silver-plated copper sheets.<br>
                    The daguerreotype became the first widely adopted photographic technique, marking the true beginning of modern photography.

            <h3>Why do people not want to be photographed?</h3>
                <p>
                    I made a survey through Google Forms for my schoolmates' voices. Based on 125 students that answered the survey are:<br>
                    36.8% of people liked being photographed because most of them are interested in photography and have confidence in<br>
                    themselves. Meanwhile, 40% of people don't like being photographed because they are self-conscious, uncomfortable,<br>
                    shy, and sometimes they just prefer being the one getting behind the camera rather than the art themselves. Lastly,<br>
                    22.4% of people don't mind getting pictures taken because they are more likely to just want to go with the flow and<br>
                    sometimes it depends on the situations or people who will take their photos.
