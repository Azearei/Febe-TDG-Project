                        <h3>What is a camera?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Imagine a tiny magic box that can steal moments right out of real life and keep
                                them forever, that’s basically what a camera means to me.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Technically, it’s a device that captures light through a lens and turns what you
                                see into a photo or video. But the cool part? It’s like a time machine for emotions.
                                One click can save a laugh, a sunset, or even your dog’s derpy face mid-zoomies. Lol
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Cameras aren’t just gadgets, they’re tools for telling stories without words.
                                And hey, even your phone has one! So we can all be photographers now. :)
                            </p>

                            </p>
                        <h3>How does the camera work?</h3>
                            <p>
                                In a film camera, light passes through the lens and hits the photosensitive film inside the camera.
                                The film is coated with light-sensitive chemicals that react to the incoming light, capturing an image
                                as a latent (invisible) image. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                            <strong>Process:</strong><br>
                                - Exposure: When you take a picture, light hits the film, causing a chemical reaction that records the image.<br>
                                - Developing: The film is submerged in a series of chemical baths to make the image visible.<br>
                                - Fixing: A fixer chemical stabilizes the image, preventing further exposure to light.<br>
                                - Printing: If the film is negative (common in traditional film photography), it is used
                                to create a positive print on light-sensitive paper.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In digital camera, it works similarly to a film camera but replaces film with an image sensor (either CMOS or CCD)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Light enters the lens; the lens focuses light onto the image sensor.
                                Image sensor captures the light; the sensor, made up of millions of
                                tiny photosites (pixels), converts light into an electrical signal.<br>
                                Image processing; the camera's image processor (such as Canon’s DIGIC or Sony’s BIONZ)
                                processes the raw sensor data, adjusting brightness, contrast, and colour.<br>
                                Image Storage; the processed image is saved as a JPED, RAW, or other format on a memory card/SD card.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Real-Time Display— unlike film cameras, digital cameras allow you to view the image immediately on the<br>
                                LCD screen or electronic viewfinder.

                        <h3>When was the first camera ever made?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Joseph Nicephore’s heliograph was the first successful attempt at capturing an image using a camera obscura
                                and a light-sensitive material, though the process required extremely long exposure times. His most famous
                                surviving image, View from the Window at Le Gras (1826 or 1827), is the earliest known permanent photograph. 
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Louis Daguerre built upon Niepce’s work and, in 1839, introduced the daguerreotype process. It significantly
                                reduced exposure times and produced sharper, more detailed images on silver-plated copper sheets.
                                The daguerreotype became the first widely adopted photographic technique, marking the true beginning of modern photography.
                            </p>


                        <h3>Why do people not want to be photographed?</h3>
                            <p>
                                I made a survey through Google Forms for my schoolmates' voices. Based on 125 students that answered the survey are:
                                36.8% of people liked being photographed because most of them are interested in photography and have confidence in>
                                themselves.
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>
                                Meanwhile, 40% of people don't like being photographed because they are self-conscious, uncomfortable,
                                shy, and sometimes they just prefer being the one getting behind the camera rather than the art themselves.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Lastly, 22.4% of people don't mind getting pictures taken because they are more likely to just want to go with the flow and
                                sometimes it depends on the situations or people who will take their photos.
                            </p>


                        <h3>What is photography about and what special about it?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Photography is a powerful form of communication that transcends cultural and linguistic barriers, acting as a universal language.
                                In today’s digital era, social media platforms like Instagram and Snapchat have amplified its influence, enabling people to share
                                experiences and emotions instantly. 
                            </p>
                                
                            <p>    
                                Photography not only captures moments but also fosters connections, promotes empathy, and highlights
                                social issues, such as environmental protection. As the world becomes increasingly globalized, photography remains a crucial tool for
                                storytelling, reflecting societal trends, and evolving with time.
                            </p>


                        <h3>Why should people learn about photography?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Learning photography skills is valuable because it enhances both personal and professional opportunities. In marketing and advertising,
                                high-quality images are essential for attracting customers, building brand identity, and communicating messages effectively.
                            </p>
                            
                            <p>
                                Understanding photography allows individuals and businesses to create visually appealing content, which is crucial in today’s
                                digital and competitive world.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Beyond marketing, photography is a powerful form of creative self-expression. Just as renowned photographers like Erick Chmil
                                use images to tell compelling stories, anyone can use photography to capture meaningful moments, share unique perspectives,
                                and develop their artistic vision. Whether for professional growth, personal storytelling, or simply documenting everyday life,
                                learning the basics of photography empowers people to communicate visually in a more impactful way. 
                            </p>


                        <h3>How photography helps people in their daily life?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Photography plays an important role in people’s daily lives by allowing them to shape and express their identities,
                                document meaningful moments, and connect with others. Self-portraits, or selfies, have become a major part of online culture,
                                helping individuals present themselves in ways that reflect their personalities and aspirations. 
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Beyond self-expression,
                                photography also enables people to challenge stereotypes and celebrate diversity. By capturing and sharing images that
                                represent different perspectives, individuals can contribute to social awareness and advocate for equality.
                                Moreover, photography influences how we see ourselves and others, shaping perceptions and emotions both consciously
                                and unconsciously.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                On a personal level, photography helps people preserve memories, tell stories, and reflect on their experiences.
                                Whether through professional photography or casual snapshots, images serve as a powerful tool for communication,
                                self-discovery, and personal growth. In a rapidly changing world, photography remains an essential medium for
                                defining identity and fostering connections in everyday life.
                            </p>


                        <h3>Why is photography a great hobby for self-expression and creativity?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Photography offers numerous benefits—especially for children; fostering creativity, observation skills,
                                self-expression, and confidence. It teaches patience, discipline, and storytelling while enhancing
                                technical proficiency and appreciation for the arts. Photography also encourages a connection to nature,
                                creates lasting memories, promotes social interaction, and can even lead to future career opportunities.
                            </p>


                        <h3>How can I improve my photography skills?</h3>
                            <p>
                                In order to improve the skills in photography, high-quality equipment and rising popularity in social media
                                can make it easier.
                            </p>


                        <h3>What personal benefits can photography bring to someone’s life?</h3>
                            <p>
                                Photography allows people to express themselves, increase their skills in technology, to also show off the cool pictures
                                and videos to impress friends and family, and more new career opportunities.
