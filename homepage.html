        <h1> Hi! I'm Faye </h1>
<p>
A photography student with a heart full of pixels and a camera full of stories.
</p>

<p>
You know that feeling when you see a photo that gives you chills? That's what I live for.
</p>

<p>
Being in front of the lens is fun, but being behind it? That's where the real adventure begins.<br>
Every click is a chance to freeze time, play with light, and uncover beauty in the unexpected.<br>
And let's be honest---without photos and videos, the internet would just be... well, a bunch of boring text. Yawn!<br>
</p>

<p>This website is my little corner to share what I've discovered so far.<br>
Photography has taught me to see the world with wonder, and I'd love for you to see it that way too.<br>
I may not have all the answers yet, but that’s the beauty of it: we’re all growing, one snapshot at a time.<br>
So whether you’re a fellow beginner or just someone who appreciate a good photo, let’s explore this beautiful, pixel-filled journey together.<br>
After all, the best shots are the ones we take while figuring things out!
